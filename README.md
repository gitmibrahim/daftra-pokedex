# Overview

This is a frontend-only Pokédex application built with React, TypeScript, and Vite that allows users to browse and view detailed information about Pokémon. The application fetches data directly from the PokéAPI and presents it in a modern, responsive interface with both pagination and infinite scroll viewing modes. Users can view Pokémon in a grid layout, see detailed stats and information for individual Pokémon, and navigate between different viewing modes. The UI features a centered design with enhanced headers, loading states, footer controls, and network error handling.
